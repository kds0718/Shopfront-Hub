# Shopfront-Hub

This is a smart contract system for a shop front on Ethereum. 

* A hub deploys spokes (multiple shop fronts). 
* It allows vendors to post items for sale and remove them with all items tracked through a central "SKU" type repository. 
* A user can purchase items using Ether or an ERC20 token. 
* Users can "co-purchase" an item together as well. 

## To Do 

* Write testing. 
* Develop a front end.
